# Zijkstra

Educational tool. Proving the shortest path through a maze with recursive SNARKs. 

## Overview

Meant for learning more about recent proving systems- [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) and [Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2) in particular- for recursive SNARKs. Verifying shortest paths found via [Dijsktra's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/). Ideal for focusing on the basic mechanics of these SNARKs since maze traversal 1) is an easy-to-visualize problem that most are familiar with and 2) doesn't involve any constraint-heavy operations such as hash functions or signature schemes. 

Why Dijkstra's insead of a simpler DFS? *Because Zijkstra is catchier than Maze Zolver of course.*
