# Zijkstra

Educational tool. Proving the shortest path through a maze with recursive SNARKs. 

## Overview

Meant for learning more about recent proving systems- [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) and [Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2) in particular- for recursive SNARKs. Verifying shortest paths found via Dijsktra's Algorithm. Ideal for focused interaction with the basic SNARK mechanics since maze traversal doesn't involve any [constraint-heavy components](https://github.com/0xPARC/circom-ecdsa) such as hash functions or signature schemes.

Why Dijkstra's insead of a simpler DFS? *Because Zijkstra is catchier than Maze Zolver of course.*
